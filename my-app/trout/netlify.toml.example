# Netlify Configuration Example
# Copy this to your activeflyfishing repo root and adjust as needed

# Option 1: If trout is a subdirectory in a monorepo
[build]
  base = "trout"
  command = "cd trout && npm install && npm run build"
  publish = "trout/.next"

# Option 2: If you're building from root with a build script
# [build]
#   command = "npm run build:trout"
#   publish = "trout/.next"

# Redirects for Next.js routing
[[redirects]]
  from = "/trout/*"
  to = "/trout/index.html"
  status = 200

# Handle Next.js static assets
[[redirects]]
  from = "/trout/_next/*"
  to = "/trout/_next/:splat"
  status = 200

# Note: Next.js with basePath handles most routing automatically
# These redirects are mainly for SPA fallback behavior
